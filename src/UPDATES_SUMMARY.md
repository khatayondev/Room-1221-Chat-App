## Overview
This document outlines all major updates and fixes applied to the Room 1221 PWA chat interface, focusing on error correction, placeholder content updates, and desktop menu enhancement following ChatGPT-style UX patterns.

---

## 1. CRITICAL FIXES

### 1.1 Color Scheme Consistency (MythBusters.tsx)
**Issue**: MythBusters component was using old green color scheme instead of the new royal blue theme.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated background gradient from `#f8f9fa` to `linear-gradient(to bottom, #FFFFFF 0%, #F8FAFE 100%)`
- Changed title color from `#006d77` (green) to `#0048ff` (royal blue)
- Updated badge border color from `#ff7b6e` to `#0048ff`
- Modified check icon color from `#006d77` to `#0048ff`
- Updated myth icon color from `#ff7b6e` to `#FF4444` (consistent red for warnings)
- Changed fact background from `#e6f4f5` to `#E8ECFF` (matching blue theme)
- Updated button border colors from `#006d77` to `#0048ff`

**Comment Added**: `// Updated color scheme to match royal blue theme (#0048ff)`

## 2. CHAT INTERFACE PLACEHOLDER UPDATES (ChatInterface.tsx)

### 2.1 Contextual AI Responses Enhancement
**Purpose**: Replace generic bot responses with specific, educational SRHR content.

**Updated placeholder Q&A by AI Agent**:

#### Question 1: "Tell me about contraception"
**AI Response**:
```
"Contraception refers to methods used to prevent pregnancy. These include options like condoms, birth control pills, injections, implants, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and natural methods. The right choice depends on your health, lifestyle, and whether you want short-term or long-term protection. It's best to consult a healthcare provider to find what works best for you."
```

#### Question 2: "What are STIs?"
**AI Response**:
```
"STIs, or sexually transmitted infections, are infections passed from one person to another through sexual contact. Examples include HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. Some STIs can also spread through blood or from mother to baby during birth. Using condoms, getting tested regularly, and maintaining safe sexual practices help prevent them."
```

#### Question 3: "Period questions"
**AI Response**:
```
"Your period, or menstruation, is the monthly shedding of the uterine lining when pregnancy doesn't occur. It usually lasts 3–7 days and happens every 21–35 days. It's normal for flow, color, or cramps to vary from person to person. If your period is irregular or very painful, it's a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional."
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Added these responses as the **first option** in each contextual response array
- Preserved existing responses as fallback options for variety
- Responses are language-aware (English, Twi, Ewe) with proper localization

**Comment Added**: `// Updated placeholder Q&A by AI Agent - Context-aware SRHR bot responses`

## 3. DESKTOP MENU ENHANCEMENT (App.tsx)

### 3.1 ChatGPT-Style Responsive Sidebar
**Purpose**: Implement intelligent sidebar behavior that adapts to screen size.

**Desktop Behavior** (≥1024px):
- Sidebar is **expanded by default** showing icons and labels
- Persists as a fixed left panel (280px width)
- Close button (X) available to collapse if desired
- Toggle button (☰) appears when collapsed to re-expand
- Smooth transitions with gradient background

**Mobile Behavior** (<1024px):
- Sidebar is **collapsed by default**
- Accessible via hamburger menu (☰) icon
- Opens as overlay Sheet component
- Auto-closes after navigation selection
- Preserves space for content on small screens

### 3.2 Implementation Details

**New State Variables**:
```typescript
const [isDesktop, setIsDesktop] = useState(false); 
// Tracks screen size for responsive behavior
```

**Responsive Detection**:
```typescript
// Desktop menu enhancement - Responsive sidebar behavior (ChatGPT-style)
useEffect(() => {
  const checkScreenSize = () => {
    const desktop = window.innerWidth >= 1024; // lg breakpoint
    setIsDesktop(desktop);
    // On desktop, keep sidebar open by default; on mobile, keep it closed
    if (desktop && !sidebarOpen) {
      setSidebarOpen(true);
    }
  };
  checkScreenSize();
  window.addEventListener('resize', checkScreenSize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', checkScreenSize);
}, []);
```

**Layout Structure**:
- Changed from flex-col to horizontal flex layout
- Added persistent `<aside>` component for desktop sidebar
- Wrapped main content in separate flex container
- Conditional rendering based on `isDesktop` and `sidebarOpen` states

**Mobile Sheet Sidebar**:
- Preserved all functionality (navigation, settings, privacy, logout)
- Added proper accessibility attributes (`aria-describedby`)
- Auto-closes on navigation to prevent blocking content
- Includes all features: language toggle, session settings, analytics opt-in

**Comments Added**:
- `// Desktop menu enhancement - default to open on desktop (ChatGPT-style behavior)`
- `// Desktop menu enhancement - Responsive sidebar behavior (ChatGPT-style)`
- `// Desktop Persistent Sidebar - ChatGPT-style behavior`
- `// Mobile Sheet Sidebar`
- `// Desktop Toggle Button`
- `// End of main content area`

## 4. LOCALIZATION IMPROVEMENTS (App.tsx)
